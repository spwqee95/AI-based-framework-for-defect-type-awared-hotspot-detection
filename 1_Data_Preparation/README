Data Preparation

1. Pattern Detection (Image Processing)
   (i)  Density matrix
   (ii) Density pyramid

2. Visaul Feature Extraction (Computer vision)
   (i)  Image
   (ii) Feature tensor (compress the image by Discrete Cosine Transform)

3. Defect Type Feature Extraction (Natural language processing)
   (i)  Word2Vec + LSTM
   (ii) Doc2Vec
